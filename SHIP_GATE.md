### Default safety posture

- [x] `[mcp]` Stack traces never exposed — structured error results only (2026-02-27)

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI tool
- [x] `[mcp]` Tool errors return structured results — server never crashes on bad input (2026-02-27)
- [x] `[mcp]` State/config corruption degrades gracefully (stale data over crash) (2026-02-27)
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app
